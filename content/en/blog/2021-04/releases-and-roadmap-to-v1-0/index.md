I did not take the time to update this website lately, my apologies!

However, we, myself and the community, did not stop working on InfiniTime. Since the last 0.11 release, we released 5 new versions of InfiniTime. Here's an overview of these releases:

 * [0.12](https://github.com/JF002/InfiniTime/releases/tag/0.12.1) : BLE connectivity improvements
 * [0.13](https://github.com/JF002/InfiniTime/releases/tag/0.13.0) : Even more BLE connectivity improvements, call notifications and vibrations on notifications
 * [0.14 "Green Avocado"](https://github.com/JF002/InfiniTime/releases/tag/0.14.0) : Update to LVGL7
 * [MCUBoot bootloader 1.0.0](https://github.com/JF002/pinetime-mcuboot-bootloader/releases/tag/1.0.0) + [InfiniTime 0.14.1 with recovery firmware](https://github.com/JF002/InfiniTime/releases/tag/0.14.1)
 * [0.15 "Yellow Banana](https://github.com/JF002/InfiniTime/releases/tag/0.15.0) : Analog clock and stopwatch

I think we are getting closer and closer to a "V1.0" version of InfiniTime. By V1.0, I don't mean a version that would compete against other commercial smartwatches or provide countless functionalities with 3 weeks of battery life. I mean a version that is suitable for enthusiasts end-user product in the philosophy of the Pine64 community.

In order to reach that milestone together, I would like to share with you my roadmap to V1.0. For this, I created a [project of Github](https://github.com/JF002/InfiniTime/projects/1). It shows tasks I think we should implement before we can tag this 1.0 release.

As I said before, I don't want to add every features we can think of, and to fix every bug. I would like to reach a point where Pine64 would be able to label the PineTime as an *enthusiast-grade end-user product*.

Of course, InfiniTime first of all community project, and everyone is welcome to give their opinion about this roadmap. Feel free to reach me (JF002) on the **[Pinetime chat rooms](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Main_Page#Community_and_Support)**, or via a [Github issue](https://github.com/JF002/InfiniTime/issues) is you want to discuss about the roadmap!
